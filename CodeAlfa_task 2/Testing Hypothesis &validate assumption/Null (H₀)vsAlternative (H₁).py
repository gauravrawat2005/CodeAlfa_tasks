Common Hypothesis Examples:

1. Mean Comparison:
   H₀: μ₁ = μ₂ (No difference between groups)
   H₁: μ₁ ≠ μ₂ (Groups are different)

2. Correlation:
   H₀: ρ = 0 (No correlation)
   H₁: ρ ≠ 0 (Significant correlation)

3. Proportion:
   H₀: p = 0.5 (Equal probability)
   H₁: p ≠ 0.5 (Different probability)
